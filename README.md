# calculator

This site contains the project documentation for the calculator project that is a toy module used in the Real Python tutorial Build Your Python Project Documentation With MkDocs. Its aim is to give you a framework to build your project documentation using Python, MkDocs, mkdocstrings, and the Material for MkDocs theme.

A useless package to demonstrate how mkdocs uses mkdocstrings to create styled documentation of your well documented project code.

Visit the [documentation site on github](https://mwwilcox.github.io/calculator)

```bash
mkdocs new .
mkdocs build
mkdocs gh-deploy
```
